-- 221
theorem q1a:

-- 7-9i
theorem q1b: 

-- 12-i
theorem q1c:

-- Find a greatest common divisor, in ℤ[i], of the following elements of ℤ[i]:
-- 37 and 5+7i
theorem q2a:

-- 52 and 9+7i
theorem q2b:

-- Let n be an integer. Show that if 4n is the sum of three squares, then so is n.
-- [Hint: If 4n = a^2+b^2+c^2, show that all of a, b and c must be even.]
theorem q3a:

-- Show that if n has the form 4^t(8k+7) for some nonnegative integer t and integer k, then n cannot be written as the sum of three squares.
-- (In fact, these are the only numbers that cannot be written as sum of three squares, but this is much harder.)
theorem q3b:

-- Use Fermat descent, starting with 557^2 + 55^2 = 26 . 12049 to write the prime 12049 as sum of two squares.
theorem q4:

-- For each of the following n, either write n as the sum of two squares, or prove that it is not possible to do so:
-- 1865
theorem q5a:

-- 77077
theorem q5b:

--609
theorem q5c:

--7501
theorem q5d:

-- Let ζ = -1/2 + sqrt(-3)/2, and let ℤ[ζ] be the subset of ∁ consisting of all complex numbers of the form a+bζ, where a,b are integers.
-- Show that ℤ[ζ] is closed under addition and multiplication.
theorem q6a:

-- Let N: ℤ[ζ] → ∁ be defined by N(z) = z­(bar z). Show that if z ∈ ℤ[ζ], then N(z) is an integer.
theorem q6b:

-- Show that for any a,b ∈ ℤ[ζ], with b ≠ 0, there exist a q, r in ℤ[ζ] such that a = bq+r and N(r) < N(b).
theorem q6c:

--Conclude that for any a,b in ℤ[ζ], a greatest common divisor of a and b exists.
theorem q6d:

-- Show that an integer prime p remains prime in ℤ[ζ] if and only if p ≡ 2 (mod 3).
-- [Hint: First show that if p ≡ 1 (mod 3), then there exists n ∈ ℤ such that p divides n^2+n+1.]
